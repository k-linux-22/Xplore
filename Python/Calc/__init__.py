'''
Rather than importing them manually in Demo file, import them different files here, as the modules in the file can then be directly used in the Demo file.

For example, instead of using,

import Calc
from Calc import addition

we won't need to use 'from Calc import addition', we can just use 'import Calc'

'''
from Calc import addition
from Calc import minus
from Calc import multiply
from Calc import divide
